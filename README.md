这是一个开源游戏机的pcb<br>

需要准备的：1.arduino pro micro -一个<br/>
          2.1.3寸oled显示屏注意是七个管脚的驱动是ssd1306（也可以是六个cs是选接的）<br>
          3.按钮6*6*4.x<br/>
          4.滑动开关(侧)四脚<br>
          5.充放一体的充电板<br/>
          6.锂电池厚度小于等于5mm<br>
          7.M2螺柱长5mm<br/>
          8.强度螺丝M2*3<br>
  两个pcb通过螺柱连接完整后只有一张名片大小，厚度是5mm<br/>
           
这个pcb板标的是v2.2<br>

This is the PCB of an open source game console. Of course, you can see that this is arduboy

I'm for someone who wants to make an arduboy but is hard to weld.

The welding quantity of this project is small and the welding is easy

This PCB is just for personal needs (lazy to weld)

What to prepare: <br>
1.Arduino Pro micro - one<br/>

2.the 1.3-inch OLED display has seven pins Drive is ssd1306(or six CS are optional)<br>

3.Button 6*6*4.x<br/>

4. Four feet of sliding switch (side)<br>

5. Charging board integrated with charging and discharging<br/>

6. Thickness of lithium battery is less than or equal to 5mm<br>

7. M2 stud length 5mm<br/>

8. Strength screw M2*3<br>
After the two PCBs are completely connected by studs, they are only the size of a business card, with a thickness of 5mm<br/>

This PCB board is marked with v2.2<br>

If you think it's interesting, you can make your own PCB board. This file can be sent directly to the manufacturer for making. Of course, you can also modify and make your own<br/>

It's just for personal entertainment. Leave it in GitHub and share it.😊😊
